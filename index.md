## Your Angular and Java Expert

To build an easy-to-use and intuitive user interface you need a frontend developer with experience and a deep understanding of the used frameworks. With over 3 years of experience in frontend development in Angular I will be a valuable help for your project. 
 

## Full-Stack with Spring and Java EE
In my experience, the highest efficiency is achieved by cutting the features vertically instead of horizontally in a sprint.
This means that the developer has to master all technologies from the data model, backend service, rest service to the frontend dialog.

My approach was to understand and be able to use every important framework on the backend like Spring or Java EE in its entirety, even if you are the frontend expert.

## SAP Connectivity
The connection to SAP provides the challenge of uniting two worlds that are different at first glance but are similar. For this, you need an expert who has experience in ABAP but is also an expert in the Java world.

With my many years of experience in ABAP combined with the knowledge from the Java and Angular world, I am of great help in realizing Java / SAP projects.

Use my knowledge of over 10 years of work as a developer in projects with different companies like: 
- RWE AG
- Raiffeisen Bankengruppe
- Ruhr Institute of Technology
- Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Germany)

## Soft skills
- Critical thinking: Good analytical skills for problem-solving
- Effective Teamwork communication 
- Flexibility and adaptability
- Time management: Ability to work detail- oriented within timelines
